TrailReplay is a browser-based GPX storytelling studio for runners, cyclists, hikers, and outdoor creators. It turns raw route files into polished, shareable replays with map animation, live stats, elevation, media, and export-ready video, all directly in the browser.

The active product lives in [`app/`](./app) and powers [trailreplay.com](https://trailreplay.com).

## Why It Exists

Most GPX tools stop at route inspection. TrailReplay is built for presentation: turning an activity, a trip, or a comparison between tracks into something easy to review, explain, and share.

## What You Can Do

- Import one or many GPX files and replay them on an interactive 3D map.
- Build a full journey by combining tracks, reordering them, and adding transport segments.
- Display live stats, elevation, pace, and route progress during playback.
- Attach photos to the route from metadata when available or place them manually.
- Add annotations and storytelling moments along the route.
- Compare tracks from the same time window and inspect timing differences.
- Export polished videos with map motion, stats overlays, elevation profile, and branded output.
- Keep the core GPX workflow local in the browser by default.

> If GitHub does not render the inline previews for your session, you can still watch them in the tutorial or open the original MP4 files in [`media/video/`](./media/video).

## Core Workflow

1. Import GPX tracks.
2. Clean up or combine them into a single journey.
3. Add photos, annotations, and visual context.
4. Replay the route on the map.
5. Export a ready-to-share video.

## Local Development

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix app install
npm run dev
```

From the app folder:

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The root scripts delegate to the active frontend in `app/`.

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite for the frontend application.
- MapLibre GL for the interactive map and route playback surfaces.
- Zustand for app state and editor workflows.
- Vitest and Testing Library for test coverage.
- A Cloudflare Pages Function in [`functions/api/contact.js`](./functions/api/contact.js) for feedback submissions.

## Repository Layout

- `app/`: active TrailReplay frontend, help pages, public assets, and tests
- `functions/`: Cloudflare Pages Functions for the deployed site
- `docs/`: internal notes, issue plans, and branding assets
- `media/`: repository media used in documentation and demos

## Notes

- The active runtime is the browser app inside `app/`.
- Legacy V1 work is not part of the current product surface.
- Help, tutorial, and GPX guide pages ship alongside the main app.
- GPX processing stays local in the browser by default; feedback submissions are the main server-side flow in this repo.
